## Notes

This is essetially the most basic version of tip calculator just following all the Codepath videos, with only a couple of simple bonus features like basic animation and opening the keyboard on default. My biggest challenge today was getting Xcode to download and work on my computer (the time it took to do this project as listed above does not include the time it took for my Xcode to download).
